# Retro-Snake
Retro snake game using raylib on C++

The executable file is in: Retro-Snake/Snake game/x64/Debug/

Features to add:
- BGM (Added eating and wall-collision sound)
- Quality control on changing directions with the use of events queue
- Let players start by moving to the left as well

Bugs to fix:
- Game speed-up is based on the time the window is opened rather than the time since the snake has started moving from its initial idle state.
